- 👀 I am interested in solving problems related to health, education, housing, transportation, infrastructure, governance and society. I am currently trying to understand power dynamics which exist in the society. For e.g. there is a power dynamics between a tenant and landlord. I have also try to figure our how can you balance the power of the other body. As per my idea, it can be possible by two step - first step is to empower the person in current system and then second step is to create an alternative of the first system.
