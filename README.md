- 👀 I am interested in solving complex soceital problems related to health, education, housing, transportation, infrastructure, governance and community leadership. I have realised many problems which exist in the society are due to traditional and inefficient power dynamics between different stakeholders of the soceity. So if you can manage and balance these dynamics, we can have a equitable, prosperous soceity. For e.g. there is a power dynamics between a tenant and landlord. In Past kings held all the power, that power is now divided in mainly three organs - legislative, judiciary and executive. This process can be summarised in two step - first step is to empower the person in current system and then second step is to create an alternative of the first system.
